# SMART Customer Support Chatbot

## Project Description

The **SMART Customer Support Chatbot** is a prototype designed to simulate a dynamic, conversational assistant for an online retail platform. This chatbot offers personalized support by drawing from user account information, past interactions, and product preferences. Using the OpenAI API, the chatbot responds to customer inquiries, suggests products, and assists with common support issues in a way that feels natural and engaging.

## Features

- **Personalized Account-Based Interactions**: Users initiate a unique chat session by entering an account number, receiving customized responses based on their data.
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: The chatbot retains conversation history within each session, allowing it to build on previous inquiries and maintain a coherent flow.
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Provides relevant product suggestions and answers based on past purchases, user preferences, and specific queries.
- **Automatic Greeting**: Once an account number is submitted, the chatbot starts with a friendly greeting, setting a welcoming tone for the interaction.
